# handlebars-engine

Template engine with [handlebars.js][] extracted out of [consolidate.js][].

## Disclaimer

All credit goes to [consolidate.js][] and its contributors. Everything in here
was extracted from there and nothing here includes any original work by me. The
only difference here is that the template engine itself is exported.

## Why

I wanted a [handlebars.js][] template engine to use with [express][] that was
responsible for only [handlebars.js][] and nothing else. I encountered no
issues at all from [consolidate.js][] which is why this does not include any
extra features or a different implementation.

This was also a learning exercise for me to get a better understanding of
[consolidate.js][]'s implementation.

## Express 3.x Example

```js
var express = require('express');
var handlebars = require('handlebars-engine');
// ...

app.engine('hbs', handlebars);
app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');

// ...

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', {
    name: 'Thor',
    partials: {
      header: 'header',
      footer: 'footer'
    },
    helpers: {
      yell: function(object) {
        return object + "!!";
      }
    }
  });
});

// ...
```
